# PIO Palnagotchi for M5 Cardputer

This is the Palnagotchi program with some customizations I made for myself to tinker and learn about m5 development. Credit goes to the original by **viniciusbo** repo here: https://github.com/viniciusbo/m5-palnagotchi

Some of the changes include:
- Make it compile on VSCode's Platform IO exension
- Make it run on my M5Cardputer
- Fixes and library updates
- Change mood more frequently
- New moods

Ideas to implement:
- Make it work on my M5 SickC Plus 2
- Ability to change palnagotchi's name through the menu
- ...

# Palnagotchi

This unit works as a friend for a Pwnagotchi. Your Pwnagotchis will see palnagotchi as a friend, and palnagotchi will se your pwnagotchis too! Palnagotchi can't PWN though, and he complains about it all the time.

## Usage

- Run the app to start advertisement.
- ESC or m toggles the menu. Use arrow keys or tab to navigate and OK to select option. Esc or m to go back to main menu.
- Top bar shows UPS level and uptime.
- Bottom bar shows total friends made in this run, all time total friends between parenthesis (needs EEPROM) and signal strengh indicator of closest friend.
- Nearby pwnagotchis show all nearby units and its signal strength.
- Palnagotchi gets a random mood every minute or so.
